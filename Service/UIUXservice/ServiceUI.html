          UI/UX design encompasses creating intuitive and user-friendly digital
          interfaces. It's a blend of art, psychology, and functionality. UI
          design focuses on screens, buttons, icons, and layout, while UX design
          considers the overall feel of the experience. Together, they ensure
          seamless interactions and delightful user journeys!

            <h3>what is <span>figma</span> ?</h3>
            <p>
              Figma is a collaborative web application for interface design. It
              enables real-time collaboration, platform-independent access, and
              prototyping. Designers and developers use Figma to create user
              interfaces, maintain design systems, and build prototypes
              seamlessly.
            </p>
            <h3>history of <span>figma</span> ?</h3>
            <p>Figma has an interesting backstory. Let's dive into it:</p>
            <p>
              <i class="bx bx-radio-circle round"></i>
              Dylan Field and Evan Wallace initiated Figma's development in 2012
              while studying computer science at Brown University. Wallace, with
              a background in graphics, served as a Teaching Assistant for the
              Computer Science Department, while Field chaired the CS
              Departmental Undergraduate Group. Their original vision was to
              create “free, simple, creative tools in a browser” that would
              empower anyone to express themselves creatively.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i class="bx bx-radio-circle round"></i>
              Before settling on Figma, they explored various ideas, including
              software for drones and even a meme generator. However, their
              focus eventually shifted to web-based graphics editing. The
              company's early scope was described vaguely as “a technology
              startup that will allow users to creatively express themselves
              online.” Initially, their ideas revolved around 3D content
              generation and later shifted to photo editing and object
              segmentation.
            </p>

              <i class="bx bx-radio-circle round"></i>
              In 2015, Figma began offering a free invite-only preview program,
              and it officially launched to the public on September 27, 2016.
              Since then, it has evolved into a powerful collaborative design
              tool, emphasizing real-time collaboration, design systems, and
              prototyping. Notably, Figma Community allows designers to publish
              their work for others to view and adapt, and FigJam—a digital
              whiteboarding feature—was introduced in 2021.

            <h3>why <span>Framer</span> is so popular ?</h3>
            <p>
              Framer distinguishes itself in the design software market with its
              strong emphasis on interactivity and real-time collaboration.
              Unlike many other tools, it doesn't merely offer a platform for
              static design mockups; instead, it enables designers to bring
              their prototypes to life with sophisticated animations and
              transitions. This focus on dynamic interactions and code-based
              customization has contributed to its growing popularity among
              UI/UX designers.
