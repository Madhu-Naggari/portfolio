            Colors play a crucial role in every design — they bring life to it,
            help add meaning to the features you implement, and make your
            product accessible through a proper contrast ratio.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, color contrast is a key consideration in the Web Content
            Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). And adherence to these guidelines
            guarantees that your design is inclusive and accessible to all
            users, regardless of their visual abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, randomly adding colors to designs can lead to trouble.
            Inconsistencies and varying shades of the same color can emerge
            across the product. And this would translate into a terrible user
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having a clear color palette helps you avoid color clashes and
            inconsistencies. It also speeds up the design process since the
            colors are already chosen, allowing you to focus more on other
            creative aspects of your work.
          </p>

            In this article, I help you build your own color palette. Follow

          <h3>How to create a color palette?</h3>
          <p>
            This section will detail the steps to create an effective color
            palette. We'll cover selecting the appropriate hierarchy, choosing a
            color model, selecting the best tools, understanding accessibility
            guidelines, and applying the five-step rule for color selection.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection3">
          <h3>1. Define your primary and secondary colors</h3>
          <p>
            Think of what colors resonate with your product. You could use your
            logo, other elements on your old design system, or colors that
            generally resonate with your brand as references.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this tutorial, I'll use blue and grey as primary colors, with
            green, red, and yellow as secondary colors (inspired by the traffic
            lights, a standard color scheme in many products).
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection4">
          <h3>2. Set a hue</h3>
          <p>
            We have tons of different color models — RGB, CMYK, Pantone, HSB,
            HEX, and HSL, among others. And one important aspect of these models
            is the hue. Understanding and controlling the hue of your colors is
            crucial for creating a harmonious (and effective) color palette.
          </p>
          <p>
            HSB is the best for a digital color palette. I say this because you
            must stick with one hue value to ensure consistency in your color
            palette. Deviating from that number might result in shades that are
            not a good fit. You can also end up with a different shade and a
            tally color:
          </p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthreeone.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            So first, define the color that meets your needs and check its hue
            value.
          </p>
          <p>
            This number is now your source of truth; you'll need to use it to
            create your scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might need to change the brightness of some shades to pass
            accessibility standards (discussed later in this article).
          </p>
          <p>I will use this blue as an example:</p>
          <div class="img-small">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthreetwo.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection5">
          <h3>3. Choose a tool to create your palette</h3>
          <p>
            ColorBox is an intuitive tool for creating palettes. Of course, you
            have other options, such as the Canva color palette generator,
            Colorspace, Kroma, and Color Hunt.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to use ColorBox because we can have our palette done
            within a few clicks, with the important codes only one click away
            from you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Set your hue, which in this case is 214. Also, ensure that the start
            and end values are the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, set all curves as linear to ensure your selected color is
            placed in the middle of this palette. If you apply other values,
            this position can vary, and then you will not have enough shades
            above or below it:
          </p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthreethree.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Define the number of steps you want. Here, I will go with eleven,
            with white at the beginning, black at the end, and nine shades
            between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also add minor steps if you need an extra shade between
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, use your main HEX code (here, #2574DB) as a major reference
            to force the color progression through the same value:
          </p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogfourfour.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            If you enable the option, you can also see all HSB and HEX codes and
            contrast ratios of the colors generated.
          </p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthreefive.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection6">
          <h3>4. Conduct an accessibility check</h3>
          <p>
            If you've been following along, you'll recall that your main color
            is the number 5, which lies exactly in the middle of your palette.
          </p>
          <p>
            This color plays an important role here: you have five lighter
            shades above it and five darker shades below it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But you must be sure that this shade has at least AA accessibility
            standards. So, test this color on black and white backgrounds, and
            to do it, you can use Adobe Color. Here's how:
          </p>
          <p>
            Go to <b>Accessibility</b> tools and select the
            <b>Contrast Checker</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, paste your color in the text field and set the background to
            white.
          </p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthreesix.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Our white background check shows a 4.57 ratio, which means it passes
            for regular and large texts and graphic components and meets the AA
            standard (WCAG 2.1 level).
          </p>
          <p>Now, let's do the same with a completely black background:</p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthreeseven.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The black background check shows a 4.6 ratio, so we are good here.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also invert the colors to double-check the ratios to ensure
            they pass AA standards in both ways.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection7">
          <h3>5. The 5-step rule</h3>
          <p>
            Now that you have successfully conducted an accessibility check on
            your main color, it is time to check the contrast between the other
            shades.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, you often cannot do this check on black and white backgrounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of my example: the lighter shade of blue has a terrible
            contrast with white, and the darker shade is barely visible on
            black:
          </p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthreeeight.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <i class="figcaption">Poor contrast ratio of light blue on white</i>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthreenine.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <i class="figcaption">Poor contrast ratio of dark blue on black</i>
          <p>
            This brings me to the 5-step rule. This rule is all about matching
            lighter and darker shades.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the color palette you just built, name your colors from 0 to 100.
            This naming is essential — it makes the matching easier as the rule
            is about combining colors that are five steps away (0 - 50, 10 - 60,
            20 - 70, 30 - 80, 40 - 90, 50 - 100):
          </p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthree10.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>After naming your colors, check if the rule is working.</p>
          <p>
            For this example, I chose the colors 10 and 60 and pasted them onto
            Adobe Color to check the ratio:
          </p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthreeeleven.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>The ratio turned out to be 5.08. Fantastic!</p>
          <p>
            Do the same with the other pairs of shades, say, 20-70, 30-80, and
            40-90, and check the ratios. These pairs should also pass the test.
          </p>
          <p>But what if your color pairs don't pass the ratio test?</p>
          <p>
            If those shades don't pass the test, it could badly impact your
            product's UX, causing bad readability and accessibility problems
            that, depending on the country, could push your work into lawsuits.
          </p>
          <p>
            To fix those that don't pass the test, go to your design tool and
            change the luminosity until you find one shade that passes the
            contrast ratio test. You could choose to make the lighter color dark
            or vice versa — it is totally up to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repeat steps two through five for all the colors you defined in the
            beginning.
          </p>
          <p>Here is the palette I created for my colors:</p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthreetwelve.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection8">
          <h3>The nightmare with yellow</h3>
          <p>
            Yellow is the hardest color to work with in terms of accessibility
            for your users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it this way — when you want to make it darker, there is no
            'dark yellow'; it turns into a shade of brown, rust, or orange.
          </p>
          <p>Plus, this color has a terrible contrast with white:</p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthreefourteen.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <i class="figcaption"
            >Poor contrast ratio of light shades of yellow on white
            backgrounds</i
          >
          <p>Let's help you find a way to work with yellow palettes.</p>
          <p>Below is a list of the different options you may choose from:</p>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection9">
          <h3>1. Remove yellow from your palette</h3>
          <p>
            Because yellow does not pass basic accessibility standards, you can
            try to remove it from your product. Choosing this way out would be
            especially easier if your design project is fresh.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if you've been working on it for a while and your design relies
            on the traffic light scheme, be careful. Changing it would mislead
            your users, as these color coils play an important role in your
            product.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are willing to change it, you must interview your users and
            test your prototype with different people to understand their
            feelings about those changes.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection10">
          <h3>2. Choose a dark background</h3>
          <p>
            As we discussed before, yellow has a bad contrast ratio with white.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wonderfully, it is the opposite when we talk about its contrast with
            black. So, if your brand color palette allows you to have a dark
            background, you can easily play with different shades of yellow. Go
            for it!
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection11">
          <h3>3. Strategically use yellow</h3>
          <p>
            You may choose to use yellow for warnings. In these design aspects,
            you must draw the user's attention to the message, not the
            background.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that if your background is not accessible, it wouldn't be
            a UX problem.
          </p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthreefifteen.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection12">
          <h3>4. Add a border</h3>
          <p>
            If you need your yellow to be visible, apply a dark border to the
            design element and then add the same color on the border and the
            text.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, if your background is yellow 30, choose yellow 80 or
            above.
          </p>
          <p>
            By doing this, you ensure all colors on that element are accessible.
            Here's an example:
          </p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="../blogimg/blogthreesixteen.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection13">
          <h3>Understanding WCAG standards</h3>
          <p>
            Creating your digital color palette is crucial in ensuring your
            product meets accessibility standards. Accessibility enhances the
            user experience for everyone — whether it's a ramp on a sidewalk, a
            color palette for a digital product, or devices that aid people with
            disabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            When developing your color palette, it's important to understand the
            WCAG 2.0 guidelines, which classify accessibility into three levels:
          </p>
          <div class="mini-sub-section-one">
            <p>
              <i class="bx bx-radio-circle"></i> <b>Level A:</b> The basic
              level, addressing minimum accessibility requirements, though often
              leaving larger issues unresolved
            </p>
            <p>
              <i class="bx bx-radio-circle"></i> <b>Level AA: </b>A mid-range
              level commonly adopted by major companies. For example, following
              guidelines like Google's Material Design ensures your color
              choices meet essential accessibility criteria
            </p>
            <p>
              <i class="bx bx-radio-circle"></i> <b>Level AAA:</b> The highest
              level, incorporating the most advanced requirements, covering
              comprehensive design and development considerations
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            A thoughtfully designed color palette that meets Level AA standards
            means your product adheres to good accessibility practices.
            Achieving Level AAA indicates that your palette — and overall design
            — exceeds typical requirements, providing an exceptional user
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, remember that a good color palette is just one part of the
            accessibility puzzle. While it's essential, comprehensive
            accessibility involves many factors beyond color choices.
          </p>
          <p>
            By focusing on creating an accessible color palette as a
            foundational step, you set the stage for designing digital products
            that are inclusive, usable, and enjoyable for all users.
