          <h1>Preparing for UX interviews: Whiteboard and home exercises</h1>
          <div class="img"><img src="blogsix.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>
            In the last few years, the tech job market has been unstable, with
            large rounds of layoffs at major companies worldwide. Being prepared
            for your next interview is important for junior and seasoned
            designers that want to stand out among the growing number of job
            seekers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning or improving how to solve product design exercises is a
            crucial skill for designers that want to land their next gig. The
            interview process is generally similar across all companies, and the
            most important part is the design challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            This article will guide readers regarding the UX interview process
            and best practices for completing take-home exercises and live
            whiteboards, which are typical design exercises all candidates will
            need to do to land their next job.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection1">
          <h3>Understanding the UX interview process</h3>
          <p>
            The first step in preparing for a UX interview is to learn how the
            interview process is typically structured. After that, we will
            present the design exercises framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            While each company may have a different interview structure, they
            generally follow a similar pattern. Here, we will focus on the most
            common tasks every product designer needs to take on in each
            process.
          </p>
          <h3>1. Application</h3>
          <p>
            When there are more applicants than available jobs, hopeful
            employees often must apply for the job online via a platform or by
            email. When the opposite is true and there are more open positions
            than talented prospects, leading companies and their recruiters
            usually actively reach out to potential talent on platforms such as
            LinkedIn or Monster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Either way, the first touchpoint in this process is when you, the
            candidate, share your portfolio and resume with the recruiter's
            team.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Phone screen</h3>
          <p>
            This step takes place over the phone or via a video call and lasts
            for about 30 minutes. The goal of the call is to see if there is a
            real match between your expectations and the business needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this conversation, the recruiter may ask you about past work
            experiences, future job interests, and salary expectations. The aim
            of the company is to clarify the job description, allow you to ask
            any further questions, and explain the next steps in the interview
            process.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Portfolio review</h3>
          <p>
            If you haven't already by this point, you'll usually meet your
            direct manager or someone closely related to the team's leadership.
            This interview will generally last for about an hour.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the first half, the manager will introduce the team's scope
            and ask about you and the professional experience, knowledge, and
            skills you can bring to the team. During the second half, you'll be
            required to present one or two cases from your portfolio to properly
            evaluate your process and abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quick tip: it's important to start your case presentation by
            showcasing data and numbers to explain why the business decided to
            work on the project. Later, show the process, and finally explain
            the outcome with numbers to evaluate the success or failure of the
            product implementation.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Design exercise</h3>
          <p>
            The design exercise is the most crucial step in the process. Here,
            you'll be asked to solve a design problem through a home exercise or
            a whiteboard challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Candidates are often asked to showcase the process and mindset
            behind their decisions while solving the problem. Later in this blog
            post, I'll explain how to prepare for this challenge and improve
            your chances of successfully landing a job offer.
          </p>
          <h3>5. Cultural interview</h3>
          <p>
            At this point, the company has already assessed your technical
            skills, but some believe it's important to know more about your soft
            skills and personal work style. Here is where the company evaluates
            the cultural fit of a candidate.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this interview, you will be assessed on a set of behaviors
            and competencies that align with the company's values. It's highly
            recommended to read about the company's core values and consider how
            you match them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Heads up: not all companies will be a good match for every
            candidate. Don't push during this stage; you don't want to work in a
            toxic environment or on a team that doesn't fit your personality or
            work style.
          </p>
          <h3>6. Offer</h3>
          <p>
            If you have successfully passed all the previous interviews, you
            will receive an offer and the recruiter will schedule some time to
            walk you through it. Take your time reviewing the offer and
            scheduling a follow-up meeting if you want to negotiate some terms.
            Finally, make a decision to accept or decline a job offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            As discussed, steps three and four above focus on assessing the
            designer's skills. The next section will prepare you for the design
            challenge aspect of the interview and provide tips and tools for
            building your portfolio and succeeding on the home exercise or
            whiteboard.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection2">
          <h3>Types of design exercises</h3>
          <p>
            A design exercise is a task designed to demonstrate a designer's
            ability to solve a problem with creative thinking and present the
            solution to an audience. There are typically two types of
            experiences companies may ask you as a candidate to complete.
          </p>

          <p>
            The challenge will vary depending on the skills the company wants to
            test. A home exercise will test visual skills, while a whiteboard
            challenge assesses a candidate's design thinking.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the next section, we will explore the proposed framework for
            solving a design exercise. You can use it or you can adjust it to
            fit your style and needs.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection3">
          <h3>Home exercise</h3>
          <p>
            If you're given a home exercise, the company will provide a design
            brief including the problem statement, previously collected
            research, design assets, and desired outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>The task may be different depending on the area the company wants to evaluate your skills. Some companies will look for user interface skills, while others will be interested in your design thinking approach.</p>
          <p>Usually the time frame to complete the exercise is eight hours and about a week of time, but you can negotiate it. The presentation needs to include a presentation, a walk-through process, and the final assets.</p>
          <p>After submitting your work, a follow-up presentation will be scheduled where the interviewers will ask you questions. Sometimes, you'll be compensated for the time spent on the exercise.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection4">
          <h3>Whiteboard exercise</h3>
          <p>This type of exercise has become the norm in the last few years. You'll have around 45 minutes to complete a design challenge, either online or in person. Generally, the interviewer will present a broad problem statement to the candidate and some data or extra resources.</p>
          <p>You'll need to perform the exercise while explaining your thought process and decisions to an audience and following the design process. When finished, you'll have about five minutes to present the proposal and the interviewer will have time to ask questions.</p>
          <p>During the exercise, you may interact with the interviewers playing a role to mimic a real-world experience; these roles are usually project manager, researcher, or data analyst. Basically, the aim of this type of exercise is to observe the way you think and interact with colleagues, more so than for you to craft a polished UI.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection5">
          <h3>Following the 5 Ws and 1 H method</h3>
          <p>I have outlined several steps to take to complete a design exercise. These steps are meant to guide you in understanding the exercise, defining a hypothetical audience, ideating possible solutions, and finally, measuring success.</p>
          <p>In real life, these steps will be decided by different stakeholders in collaboration with other team members. Remember, this isn't a strict method to follow. Use your judgment regarding when to apply it. However, it may provide a helpful reference that will help you create the best framework to use in your next job interview.</p>
          <h4>Step 1: Why (understand the problem)</h4>
          <p>Product design may sound quite artistic, but every beautifully crafted user interface has a backstory. A product designer's job is to create a meaningful UX to help users complete potentially complex tasks, all packaged in appealing visuals for the user's delight.</p>
          <p>Understanding the problems we're facing is crucial to finding a good solution. Therefore, it's important to define our objectives. The top three questions to answer here are:</p>
            <div class="mini-sub-section-one">
            <p>
              <i class="num">1. </i>What problem are we trying to solve?
            </p>
            <p>
              <i class="num">2. </i>How does this solution benefit the customer?
            </p>
                        <p>
              <i class="num">3. </i>How does this solution benefit the business?
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>Use these questions in your next whiteboard or home exercise to present the problem to the audience and translate the vision into a business opportunity.</p>
          <p>During whiteboard exercises, remember you can ask questions. You're expected to engage with your interviewers and ask for any necessary clarifications.</p>
          <p>Here's an example scenario you can use to practice this step:</p>
          <i class="differ-text">Our product is a parental control software. The app was designed to help parents monitor and control children's digital activity. We identified 46% of users have difficulties completing tasks successfully using the current navigation system, which is causing dissatisfaction and a high rate of non-completions or bounces. We are aiming to improve task completion rates and satisfaction by improving the information architecture with a better grouping, labeling, and hierarchy system.</i>
          <h3>Step 2: Who (define the audience)</h3>
          <p>There is one typical mistake that kills companies: not building products for its users, but instead building products for the stakeholders. Ego is normal in humans, but we need to avoid letting it guide us. Instead, focus on listening to our target audience — the ones who will use and pay for the product.</p>
          <p>Define your audience and understand who you are building the product for. If you don't understand your audience, you are taking the risk of building a product that users don't want. The top three questions to answer here are:</p>
          <div class="mini-sub-section-one">
            <p><i class="num">1. </i>What is your audience's age, gender, location, and occupation?</p>
                        <p><i class="num">2. </i>From all the audience types you can identify, which audience will you design for?</p>
                                    <p><i class="num">3. </i>What does your audience need?</p>
          </div>
          <p>For example, if your product is a creative e-learning platform, your audience might include:</p>
          <div class="mini-sub-section">
            <p>
              <i class="bx bx-radio-circle"></i> Graphic design enthusiasts, but not professionals based in cities with professional jobs
            </p>
            <p>
              <i class="bx bx-radio-circle"></i> Mainly females who need some design knowledge for their day-to-day jobs
            </p>
            <p>
              <i class="bx bx-radio-circle"></i> Young professionals aiming to help in little design tasks
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>From there, you'll need to think strategically about which audience you'll design for and what they need.</p>
          <h3>Step 3: When and where? (define context and needs)</h3>
          <p>After defining the audience, it is important to understand when and where the audience experiences the problem stated, and how you can create a digital solution to solve it. This context will help you design the future product or feature for our users to enjoy.</p>
          <p>During this step, you'll need to describe the environment where your target audience experiences the problem. This will help you better understand their context and needs. The top three questions to answer here are:</p>
          <div class="mini-sub-section-one">
            <p><i class="num">1. </i>Where are they physically? Are they on a digital web or app?</p>
            <p><i class="num">2. </i>How much time do they have?</p>
            <p><i class="num">3. </i>What is the customer's motivation to solve the problem?</p>
          </div>
          <p>For example, users of an accounting app may include accountants or bookkeepers may prefer using a desktop over a phone for accounting tasks. Therefore, they might use the app only when they don't have desktop access. They will use the app only for minor tasks or during public transportation commutes.</p>
          <h3>Step 4: What? (Ideation)</h3>
          <p>In this section, we need to conduct a brainstorm session to generate between three to five ideas to solve the previously stated problem. Remember to consider the audience for whom we are building the product, the place, and the time they will use it, and why they have a problem.</p>
        <p>If you have multiple ideas, you can use a prioritization matrix with impact on the X axis and effort on the Y axis, and then decide which idea would have the most impact with the least effort. The top three questions to answer here are:</p>
          <div class="mini-sub-section-one">
            <p><i class="num">1. </i>What type of product are you thinking about?</p>
            <p><i class="num">2. </i>Where will this product be built? Mobile, web, or both?</p>
            <p><i class="num">3. </i>What interface will be used? Voice, audio, AI…</p>
          </div>
          <p>For example, imagine you're creating something to help people looking for a shared apartment. You could build an app with AI to match people looking to rent out bedrooms with people looking to occupy them. The AI will help them by matching potential people that have the same beliefs and interests to improve the satisfaction rate when cohabitating.</p>
          <h3>Ideation during whiteboard vs. home exercises</h3>
          <p>During the ideation stage, there's a huge difference between completing a home exercise and a whiteboard exercise.</p>
          <p>Generally, the whiteboard exercise allows candidates to write ideas and maybe create a quick and preliminary draft of it using shapes and colors. In contrast, a take-home exercise will require the candidate to solve the problem, creating a storyboard, a user flow, and the final screens with a polished UI.</p>
          <p>You may notice this step is what takes up most of the time allowance for the exercise. Make sure you practice balancing your time — you don't want to rush the other steps, but you definitely need to give yourself sufficient time for ideation.</p>
          <h3>Step 5: How (measure success)</h3>
          <p>How do we know if the solution was successful? Nothing matters if what we build doesn't appeal to our users and nobody uses it.</p>
          <p>It's time to close the gap and define how we can validate the solution. A common practice is to define metrics or KPIs to track and define what metrics indicate success. For the sake of the exercise, if you don't have current metrics, establish a baseline. Typical metrics to consider might include:</p>
          <div class="mini-sub-section-one">
            <p><i class="num">1. </i>Success rate</p>
            <p><i class="num">2. </i>Task completion</p>
            <p><i class="num">3. </i>Time on task</p>
            <p><i class="num">4. </i>Engagement</p>
            <p><i class="num">5. </i>Retention rate - How often does the customer come back?</p>
            <p><i class="num">6. </i>Conversion rate — Visitors that turn into customers</p>
            <p><i class="num">7. </i>Revenue - Money generated from this channel</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section id="subSection6">
          <h3>Allocating time for each step and your presentation</h3>
          <p>Each step involves significant effort, but with practice, you can automate tasks and save time. Below is a suggested time allocation for a 45-minute whiteboard exercise:</p>
                    <div class="mini-sub-section">
            <p>
              <i class="bx bx-radio-circle"></i> <b>step1: </b> Why — 5 minutes
            </p>
            <p>
              <i class="bx bx-radio-circle"></i> <b>Step 2: </b>Who — 5 minutes
            </p>
            <p>
              <i class="bx bx-radio-circle"></i><b>Step 3: </b> When and where — 5 minutes
            </p>
            <p><i class="bx bx-radio-circle"></i><b>Step 4: </b>What — 20 minutes</p>
            <p><i class="bx bx-radio-circle"></i><b>Step 5</b>How — 5 minutes</p>
            <p><i class="bx bx-radio-circle">Presentation — 5 minutes</i></p>
          </div>
          <p>If you have additional time, allocate it to step four to showcase your ideation and problem-solving skills. Remember that take-home tasks will give you more time you can use at your convenience. This extra time will allow you to create some slides to present your ideas and highlight the interesting findings of each six steps.</p>
          <p>When presenting for a whiteboard exercise, remember to start by discussing the scope of the exercise. Throughout your presentation, address the highlights of the exercise, as well as the blind spots you didn't have time to tackle.</p>
          <p>By the end of the presentation, demonstrate an open mind for discussing further arguments and answering questions — but try to be concise as well.</p>
